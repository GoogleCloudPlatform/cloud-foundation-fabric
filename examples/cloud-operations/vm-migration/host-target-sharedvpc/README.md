# M4CE(v5) - Host and Target Projects with Shared VPC

This example creates a Migrate for Compute Engine (v5) environment deployed on an host project with multiple [target projects](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/docs/5.0/how-to/enable-services#identifying_your_host_project) and shared VPCs.

The example is designed to implement a M4CE (v5) environment on-top of complex migration landing environment where VMs have to be migrated to multiple target projects. In this example targets are alse service projects for a shared VPC. It also includes the IAM wiring needed to make such scenarios work.

## Managed resources and services

This sample creates\update several distinct groups of resources:

- projects
  - M4CE host project with [required services](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/docs/5.0/how-to/enable-services#enabling_required_services_on_the_host_project) deployed on a new or existing project. 
  - M4CE target project prerequisites deployed on existing projects. 
- IAM
  - Create a [service account](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/docs/5.0/how-to/migrate-connector#step-3) used at runtime by the M4CE connector for data replication
  - Grant [migration admin roles](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/docs/5.0/how-to/enable-services#using_predefined_roles) to provided user accounts.
  - Grant [migration viewer role](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/docs/5.0/how-to/enable-services#using_predefined_roles) to provided user accounts.
  - Grant [roles on shared VPC](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/docs/5.0/how-to/target-project#configure-permissions) to migration admins

## Outputs

| name | description | sensitive |

## Manual Steps
Once this example is deployed the M4CE [m4ce_gmanaged_service_account](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/docs/5.0/how-to/target-sa-compute-engine#configuring_the_default_service_account) has to be configured to grant the access to the shared VPC and allow the deploy of Compute Engine instances as the result of the migration.
