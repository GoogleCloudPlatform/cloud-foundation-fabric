# GCVE

The GCVE stage builds on top of your foundations to create CÃ¬and set up projects and related resources, used for your data workloads and pipelines.
It is organized in folders representing environments (e.g. `dev`, `prod`), each implemented by a stand-alone Terraform setup.

This directory contains a [GCVE single region private cloud for the `dev` environment](./dev/) that can be used as-is, and cloned with few changes to implement further environments. Refer to the example [`dev/README.md`](./dev/README.md) for configuration details.
