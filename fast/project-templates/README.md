# FAST Project Templates

Each of the folders contained here is a separate Terraform configuration, that can be used to bring up specific sets of resources. All the configurations include a `project.yaml` file in project factory format, that can be directly used after some light edits to bring up a project with the required prerequisites. The project file can also be used as documentation to create a suitable project via other means, where a project factory is not available.
