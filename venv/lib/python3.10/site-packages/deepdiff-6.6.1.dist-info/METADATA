## Modules

- [DeepDiff](https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/diff.html): Deep Difference of dictionaries, iterables, strings, and ANY other object.
- [DeepSearch](https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/dsearch.html): Search for objects within other objects.
- [DeepHash](https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/deephash.html): Hash any object based on their content.
- [Delta](https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/delta.html): Store the difference of objects and apply them to other objects.
- [Extract](https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/extract.html): Extract an item from a nested Python object using its path.
- [commandline](https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/commandline.html): Use DeepDiff from commandline.

Tested on Python 3.7+ and PyPy3.

### A message from Sep, the creator of DeepDiff

> 👋 Hi there,
>
> Thank you for using DeepDiff!
> As an engineer, I understand the frustration of wrestling with **unruly data** in pipelines.
> That's why I developed a new tool - [Qluster](https://qluster.ai/solution) to empower non-engineers to control and resolve data issues at scale autonomously and **stop bugging the engineers**! 🛠️
>
> If you are going through this pain now, I would love to give you [early access](https://www.qluster.ai/try-qluster) to Qluster and get your feedback.


# ChangeLog

Please take a look at the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file.

# Survey

:mega: **Please fill out our [fast 5-question survey](https://forms.gle/E6qXexcgjoKnSzjB8)** so that we can learn how & why you use DeepDiff, and what improvements we should make. Thank you! :dancers:

# Contribute

1. Please make your PR against the dev branch
2. Please make sure that your PR has tests. Since DeepDiff is used in many sensitive data driven projects, we strive to maintain around 100% test coverage on the code.

Please run `pytest --cov=deepdiff --runslow` to see the coverage report. Note that the `--runslow` flag will run some slow tests too. In most cases you only want to run the fast tests which so you wont add the `--runslow` flag.

Or to see a more user friendly version, please run: `pytest --cov=deepdiff --cov-report term-missing --runslow`.

Thank you!
