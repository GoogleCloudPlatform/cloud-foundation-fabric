              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

## Introduction

YAPF is a Python formatter based off of [`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html)
(developed by Daniel Jasper). In essence, the algorithm takes the code and
calculates the best formatting that conforms to the configured style. It takes
away a lot of the drudgery of maintaining your code.

The ultimate goal is that the code YAPF produces is as good as the code that a
programmer would write if they were following the style guide.

> **Note**
> YAPF is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is
> just code that happens to be owned by Google.


## Installation

To install YAPF from PyPI:

```bash
$ pip install yapf
```

YAPF is still considered in "beta" stage, and the released version may change
often; therefore, the best way to keep up-to-date with the latest development
is to clone this repository.

Note that if you intend to use YAPF as a command-line tool rather than as a
library, installation is not necessary. YAPF supports being run as a directory
by the Python interpreter. If you cloned/unzipped YAPF into `DIR`, it's
possible to run:

```bash
$ PYTHONPATH=DIR python DIR/yapf [options] ...
```


## Required Python versions

YAPF supports Python 3.7+.

> **Note**
> YAPF requires the code it formats to be valid Python for the version YAPF
> itself runs under.


## Usage

```console
usage: yapf [-h] [-v] [-d | -i | -q] [-r | -l START-END] [-e PATTERN]
            [--style STYLE] [--style-help] [--no-local-style] [-p] [-m] [-vv]
            [files ...]

Formatter for Python code.

positional arguments:
  files                 reads from stdin when no files are specified.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -d, --diff            print the diff for the fixed source
  -i, --in-place        make changes to files in place
  -q, --quiet           output nothing and set return value
  -r, --recursive       run recursively over directories
  -l START-END, --lines START-END
                        range of lines to reformat, one-based
  -e PATTERN, --exclude PATTERN
                        patterns for files to exclude from formatting
  --style STYLE         specify formatting style: either a style name (for
                        example "pep8" or "google"), or the name of a file
                        with style settings. The default is pep8 unless a
                        .style.yapf or setup.cfg or pyproject.toml file
                        located in the same directory as the source or one of
                        its parent directories (for stdin, the current
                        directory is used).
  --style-help          show style settings and exit; this output can be saved
                        to .style.yapf to make your settings permanent
  --no-local-style      don't search for local style definition
  -p, --parallel        run YAPF in parallel when formatting multiple files.
  -m, --print-modified  print out file names of modified files
  -vv, --verbose        print out file names while processing
```

### Using YAPF within your favorite editor
YAPF is supported by multiple editors via community extensions or plugins. See [Editor Support](EDITOR%20SUPPORT.md) for more info.

### Return Codes

Normally YAPF returns zero on successful program termination and non-zero
otherwise.

If `--diff` is supplied, YAPF returns zero when no changes were necessary,
non-zero otherwise (including program error). You can use this in a CI workflow
to test that code has been YAPF-formatted.

### Excluding files from formatting (.yapfignore or pyproject.toml)

In addition to exclude patterns provided on commandline, YAPF looks for
additional patterns specified in a file named `.yapfignore` or `pyproject.toml`
located in the working directory from which YAPF is invoked.

`.yapfignore`'s syntax is similar to UNIX's filename pattern matching:

```
*       matches everything
?       matches any single character
[seq]   matches any character in seq
[!seq]  matches any character not in seq
```

Note that no entry should begin with `./`.

If you use `pyproject.toml`, exclude patterns are specified by `ignore_patterns` key
in `[tool.yapfignore]` section. For example:

```ini
[tool.yapfignore]
ignore_patterns = [
  "temp/**/*.py",
  "temp2/*.py"
]
```


Formatting style
================

The formatting style used by YAPF is configurable and there are many "knobs"
that can be used to tune how YAPF does formatting. See the `style.py` module
for the full list.

To control the style, run YAPF with the `--style` argument. It accepts one of
the predefined styles (e.g., `pep8` or `google`), a path to a configuration
file that specifies the desired style, or a dictionary of key/value pairs.

The config file is a simple listing of (case-insensitive) `key = value` pairs
with a `[style]` heading. For example:

```ini
[style]
based_on_style = pep8
spaces_before_comment = 4
split_before_logical_operator = true
```

The `based_on_style` setting determines which of the predefined styles this
custom style is based on (think of it like subclassing). Four
styles are predefined:

- `pep8` (default)
- `google` (based off of the [Google Python Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md))
- `yapf` (for use with Google open source projects)
- `facebook`

See `_STYLE_NAME_TO_FACTORY` in [`style.py`](https://github.com/google/yapf/blob/main/yapf/yapflib/style.py) for details.

It's also possible to do the same on the command line with a dictionary. For
example:

```bash
--style='{based_on_style: pep8, indent_width: 2}'
```

This will take the `pep8` base style and modify it to have two space
indentations.

YAPF will search for the formatting style in the following manner:

1. Specified on the command line
2. In the `[style]` section of a `.style.yapf` file in either the current
   directory or one of its parent directories.
3. In the `[yapf]` section of a `setup.cfg` file in either the current
   directory or one of its parent directories.
4. In the `[tool.yapf]` section of a `pyproject.toml` file in either the current
   directory or one of its parent directories.
5. In the `[style]` section of a `~/.config/yapf/style` file in your home
   directory.

If none of those files are found, the default style PEP8 is used.


Example
=======

An example of the type of formatting that YAPF can do, it will take this ugly
code:

```python
x = {  'a':37,'b':42,

'c':927}

y = 'hello ''world'
z = 'hello '+'world'
a = 'hello {}'.format('world')
class foo  (     object  ):
  def f    (self   ):
    return       37*-+2
  def g(self, x,y=42):
      return y
def f  (   a ) :
  return      37+-+a[42-x :  y**3]
```

and reformat it into:

```python
x = {'a': 37, 'b': 42, 'c': 927}

y = 'hello ' 'world'
z = 'hello ' + 'world'
a = 'hello {}'.format('world')


class foo(object):
    def f(self):
        return 37 * -+2

    def g(self, x, y=42):
        return y


def f(a):
    return 37 + -+a[42 - x:y**3]
```


## Example as a module

The two main APIs for calling YAPF are `FormatCode` and `FormatFile`, these
share several arguments which are described below:

```python
>>> from yapf.yapflib.yapf_api import FormatCode  # reformat a string of code

>>> formatted_code, changed = FormatCode("f ( a = 1, b = 2 )")
>>> formatted_code
'f(a=1, b=2)\n'
>>> changed
True
```

A `style_config` argument: Either a style name or a path to a file that
contains formatting style settings. If None is specified, use the default style
as set in `style.DEFAULT_STYLE_FACTORY`.

```python
>>> FormatCode("def g():\n  return True", style_config='pep8')[0]
'def g():\n    return True\n'
```

A `lines` argument: A list of tuples of lines (ints), [start, end], that we
want to format. The lines are 1-based indexed. It can be used by third-party
code (e.g., IDEs) when reformatting a snippet of code rather than a whole file.

```python
>>> FormatCode("def g( ):\n    a=1\n    b = 2\n    return a==b", lines=[(1, 1), (2, 3)])[0]
'def g():\n    a = 1\n    b = 2\n    return a==b\n'
```

A `print_diff` (bool): Instead of returning the reformatted source, return a
diff that turns the formatted source into reformatted source.

```diff
>>> print(FormatCode("a==b", filename="foo.py", print_diff=True)[0])
--- foo.py (original)
+++ foo.py (reformatted)
@@ -1 +1 @@
-a==b
+a == b
```

Note: the `filename` argument for `FormatCode` is what is inserted into the
diff, the default is `<unknown>`.

`FormatFile` returns reformatted code from the passed file along with its encoding:

```python
>>> from yapf.yapflib.yapf_api import FormatFile  # reformat a file

>>> print(open("foo.py").read())  # contents of file
a==b

>>> reformatted_code, encoding, changed = FormatFile("foo.py")
>>> formatted_code
'a == b\n'
>>> encoding
'utf-8'
>>> changed
True
```

The `in_place` argument saves the reformatted code back to the file:

```python
>>> FormatFile("foo.py", in_place=True)[:2]
(None, 'utf-8')

>>> print(open("foo.py").read())  # contents of file (now fixed)
a == b
```


## Formatting diffs

Options:

```console
usage: yapf-diff [-h] [-i] [-p NUM] [--regex PATTERN] [--iregex PATTERN][-v]
                 [--style STYLE] [--binary BINARY]

This script reads input from a unified diff and reformats all the changed
lines. This is useful to reformat all the lines touched by a specific patch.
Example usage for git/svn users:

  git diff -U0 --no-color --relative HEAD^ | yapf-diff -i
  svn diff --diff-cmd=diff -x-U0 | yapf-diff -p0 -i

It should be noted that the filename contained in the diff is used
unmodified to determine the source file to update. Users calling this script
directly should be careful to ensure that the path in the diff is correct
relative to the current working directory.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i, --in-place        apply edits to files instead of displaying a diff
  -p NUM, --prefix NUM  strip the smallest prefix containing P slashes
  --regex PATTERN       custom pattern selecting file paths to reformat
                        (case sensitive, overrides -iregex)
  --iregex PATTERN      custom pattern selecting file paths to reformat
                        (case insensitive, overridden by -regex)
  -v, --verbose         be more verbose, ineffective without -i
  --style STYLE         specify formatting style: either a style name (for
                        example "pep8" or "google"), or the name of a file
                        with style settings. The default is pep8 unless a
                        .style.yapf or setup.cfg or pyproject.toml file
                        located in the same directory as the source or one of
                        its parent directories (for stdin, the current
                        directory is used).
  --binary BINARY       location of binary to use for YAPF
```

## (Potentially) Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does YAPF destroy my awesome formatting?

YAPF tries very hard to get the formatting correct. But for some code, it won't
be as good as hand-formatting. In particular, large data literals may become
horribly disfigured under YAPF.

The reasons for this are manyfold. In short, YAPF is simply a tool to help
with development. It will format things to coincide with the style guide, but
that may not equate with readability.

What can be done to alleviate this situation is to indicate regions YAPF should
ignore when reformatting something:

```python
# yapf: disable
FOO = {
    # ... some very large, complex data literal.
}

BAR = [
    # ... another large data literal.
]
# yapf: enable
```

You can also disable formatting for a single literal like this:

```python
BAZ = {
    (1, 2, 3, 4),
    (5, 6, 7, 8),
    (9, 10, 11, 12),
}  # yapf: disable
```

To preserve the nice dedented closing brackets, use the
`dedent_closing_brackets` in your style. Note that in this case all
brackets, including function definitions and calls, are going to use
that style.  This provides consistency across the formatted codebase.

### Why Not Improve Existing Tools?

We wanted to use clang-format's reformatting algorithm. It's very powerful and
designed to come up with the best formatting possible. Existing tools were
created with different goals in mind, and would require extensive modifications
to convert to using clang-format's algorithm.

### Can I Use YAPF In My Program?

Please do! YAPF was designed to be used as a library as well as a command line
tool. This means that a tool or IDE plugin is free to use YAPF.

### I still get non-PEP8 compliant code! Why?

YAPF tries very hard to be fully PEP 8 compliant. However, it is paramount
to not risk altering the semantics of your code. Thus, YAPF tries to be as
safe as possible and does not change the token stream
(e.g., by adding parentheses).
All these cases however, can be easily fixed manually. For instance,

```python
from my_package import my_function_1, my_function_2, my_function_3, my_function_4, my_function_5

FOO = my_variable_1 + my_variable_2 + my_variable_3 + my_variable_4 + my_variable_5 + my_variable_6 + my_variable_7 + my_variable_8
```

won't be split, but you can easily get it right by just adding parentheses:

```python
from my_package import (my_function_1, my_function_2, my_function_3,
                        my_function_4, my_function_5)

FOO = (my_variable_1 + my_variable_2 + my_variable_3 + my_variable_4 +
       my_variable_5 + my_variable_6 + my_variable_7 + my_variable_8)
```


## Gory Details

### Algorithm Design

The main data structure in YAPF is the `LogicalLine` object. It holds a list
of `FormatToken`\s, that we would want to place on a single line if there
were no column limit. An exception being a comment in the middle of an
expression statement will force the line to be formatted on more than one line.
The formatter works on one `LogicalLine` object at a time.

An `LogicalLine` typically won't affect the formatting of lines before or
after it. There is a part of the algorithm that may join two or more
`LogicalLine`\s into one line. For instance, an if-then statement with a
short body can be placed on a single line:

```python
if a == 42: continue
```

YAPF's formatting algorithm creates a weighted tree that acts as the solution
space for the algorithm. Each node in the tree represents the result of a
formatting decision --- i.e., whether to split or not to split before a token.
Each formatting decision has a cost associated with it. Therefore, the cost is
realized on the edge between two nodes. (In reality, the weighted tree doesn't
have separate edge objects, so the cost resides on the nodes themselves.)

For example, take the following Python code snippet. For the sake of this
example, assume that line (1) violates the column limit restriction and needs to
be reformatted.

```python
def xxxxxxxxxxx(aaaaaaaaaaaa, bbbbbbbbb, cccccccc, dddddddd, eeeeee):  # 1
    pass                                                               # 2
```

For line (1), the algorithm will build a tree where each node (a
`FormattingDecisionState` object) is the state of the line at that token given
the decision to split before the token or not. Note: the `FormatDecisionState`
objects are copied by value so each node in the graph is unique and a change in
one doesn't affect other nodes.

Heuristics are used to determine the costs of splitting or not splitting.
Because a node holds the state of the tree up to a token's insertion, it can
easily determine if a splitting decision will violate one of the style
requirements. For instance, the heuristic is able to apply an extra penalty to
the edge when not splitting between the previous token and the one being added.

There are some instances where we will never want to split the line, because
doing so will always be detrimental (i.e., it will require a backslash-newline,
which is very rarely desirable). For line (1), we will never want to split the
first three tokens: `def`, `xxxxxxxxxxx`, and `(`. Nor will we want to
split between the `)` and the `:` at the end. These regions are said to be
"unbreakable." This is reflected in the tree by there not being a "split"
decision (left hand branch) within the unbreakable region.

Now that we have the tree, we determine what the "best" formatting is by finding
the path through the tree with the lowest cost.

And that's it!
