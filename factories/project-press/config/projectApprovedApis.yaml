      The API described on this page is the Firebase Cloud Messaging Legacy API, which
      comprises of Legacy HTTP and Legacy XMPP. If you are integrating messaging in
      a new app, start with the latest HTTP v1 API instead (https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/fcm/rest/v1/projects.messages).
      If you are an existing user of the FCM Legacy API (HTTP or XMPP), consider migrating
      to the HTTP v1 API (https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1).
      GCM has been deprecated. If your app is using the GCM SDK, upgrade to the FCM
