# Hub and spoke via VPN VPC architecture

This blueprint was deprecated in the v30.0.0 release, as it's been supersed by the [FAST networking stage](../../../fast/stages/2-networking-b-vpn/) that deploys a hub and spoke network via VPN, which is regularly updated and can also be deployed as a standalone blueprint.

If you still need to access the legacy blueprint, you can check it out using our [v29.0.0 tag](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-fabric/tree/v29.0.0/blueprints/networking/hub-and-spoke-vpn).
