# Deprecated: Terraform Blueprints for Google Cloud

> This directory is deprecated as of release `v44.0.0`.

The blueprints that were previously in this directory have been deprecated. Some of the old blueprints will be refactored as either FAST project templates or module-level recipes. If there is a specific blueprint that you would like to see refactored, please submit a PR or open a feature request.

You can still browse and checkout the old code from the [`v43.0.0` tag](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-fabric/tree/v43.0.0/blueprints), or download the [`v43.0.0` release](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-fabric/releases/tag/v43.0.0). Please note that this notice will also be removed in a future version.
