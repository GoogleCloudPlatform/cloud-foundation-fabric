# Deprecated: Terraform Blueprints for Google Cloud

**This directory is deprecated as of release `v44.0.0`.**

The blueprints that were previously in this directory have been deprecated. Some of the old blueprints will be refactored as either FAST project templates or module-level recipes.

If there is a specific blueprint that you would like to see refactored, please open a feature request.

The last version of the blueprints is available in the `v43.0.0` tag. You can still use them by referencing this tag in your Terraform configuration.

You can browse the complete list of blueprints and their documentation in the [`v43.0.0` blueprints directory](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-fabric/tree/v43.0.0/blueprints).
