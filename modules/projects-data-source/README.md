# Projects Data Source Module 

This module extends functionality of [google_projects](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/data-sources/projects) data source by retrieving all the projects under a specific `parent` recursively with only one API call against [Cloud Asset Inventory](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory) service. 

A good usage pattern would be when we want all the projects under a specific folder (including nested subfolders) to be included into [VPC Service Controls](../vpc-sc/). Instead of manually maintaining the list of project numbers as an input to the `vpc-sc` module we can use that module to retrieve all the project numbers dynamically.

### IAM Permissions required

- `roles/cloudasset.viewer` on the `parent` level or above


## Examples

### All projects in my org

```hcl
module "my-org" {
  source     = "./fabric/modules/projects-data-source"
  parent     = "organizations/123456789"
}

output "project_numbers" {
  value = module.my-org.project_numbers
}

# tftest skip (uses data sources)
```

### My dev projects based on parent and label

```hcl
module "my-dev" {
  source = "./fabric/modules/projects-data-source"
  parent = "folders/123456789"
  query = "labels.env:DEV state:ACTIVE"
}

output "dev-projects" {
  value = module.my-dev.projects
}

# tftest skip (uses data sources)
```

### Projects under org with folder/project exclusions
```hcl
module "my-filtered" {
  source = "./fabric/modules/projects-data-source"
  parent     = "organizations/123456789"
  ignore_projects = [
    "sandbox-*",       # wildcard ignore
    "project-full-id", # specific project id
    "0123456789"       # specific project number
  ]

  include_projects = [
    "sandbox-114",  # include specific project which was excluded by wildcard
    "415216609246"  # include specific project which was excluded by wildcard (by project number)
  ]

  ignore_folders = [  # subfolders are ingoner as well
    "343991594985", 
    "437102807785",
    "345245235245"
  ]
  query = "state:ACTIVE"
}

output "filtered-projects" {
  value = module.my-filtered.projects
}

# tftest skip (uses data sources)

```
